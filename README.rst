CRAMS
======

Overview
---------
The Monash University developed Cloud Resource Allocation Management System (CRAMS) is for resource allocation, instantiation and to report resource utilisation across Research Data Storage,  High Performance Computing Platform (HPC), Research Computing Cloud and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.  CRAMS not only enables researchers to request access to resources across  research storage, cloud and  HPC allocations, it also collects project details across all allocations over time to form a rich metadata registry. CRAMS is a production system that is meeting key milestones of its transformation-driven road map. 

CRAMS will provide an effective self service mechanism for researchers and research facilities  to request cloud resources, monitor usage and manage own allocations.  CRAMS will further enable faster processing of resource allocation requests and provisioning of resources to end users. CRAMS reporting will enable effective strategic decisions on resource planning across Monash Research Data Storage, High Performance Computing Platform and Research Computing Cloud to address research needs better.
