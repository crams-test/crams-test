The Monash University developed Cloud Resource Allocation Management System (CRAMS) is for resource allocation, instantiation and to report resource utilisation across Research Data Storage,  High Performance Computing Platform (HPC), Research Computing Cloud and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.  CRAMS not only enables researchers to request access to resources across  research storage, cloud and  HPC allocations, it also collects project details across all allocations over time to form a rich metadata registry. CRAMS is a production system that is meeting key milestones of its transformation-driven road map.
